### Notes regarding the build system

The code files here are taken from the SDK folder: `ti\easylink`.
When new versions are made available these should be replaced with them.
The EasyLink configuration file (`easylink_config.h`) is to be placed in each target **NOT** here. This allows each target to fine tune it's configuration.
